# Steamgamer

A Github-based curated collection of websites and tools for Steam users.

## What is Curation?

Curation is the act of collecting and sorting information to a particular topic. Steamgamer collects and sorts useful websites and apps related to Steam.

## Where has the old Steamgamer.de gone?

It's gone.

## Why is it gone?

At the beginning, Steamgamer was a german news and tips portal for Steam. It started after the first official annoucements of the Steam Machines, SteamOS, and the Steam Controller in late 2013. Since then, Valve failed to deliver. The Steam Machines never had an impact, SteamOS' performance is far behind Windows 10, not to mention the lack of Triple-A games. That minimizes the value of plattform dedicated to the Steam Universe.

## How can I add my site?

That's simple.

1. Fork Steamgamer on Github.
2. Copy one of the files in '_curation' and name it after your site, i.e. 'steamdb.md' for SteamDB.info.
3. Edit the new file. Fill it with the corresponding information of your site.
4. Create a Pull Request.
5. After our approval, the site will be added to the curation.

## Do you have a sample file for new curation entries?

Jep.
